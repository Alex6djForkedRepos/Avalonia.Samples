== üìÇ Organization of the Samples

Every sample can be found in its own sub-folder and can run without any reference to another sample. Nevertheless we have a `*.sln`-File which has all projects in one solution, if you are looking for a complete collection of samples. 

You can find the list of samples <<samples,below>>. The samples are structured in different categories and difficulties. For better search results, each sample is also tagged with some **buzz-words**.

In every sample folder you will find a `README`-File, which describes the sample in detail and, if applicable, has links to further information and documentation. 

=== üê£ Difficulties

Each sample is tagged with it's difficulty. The degree of difficulty describes how much base-knowledge a user should have.

==== Fixing an existing sample

If you find that in an existing sample, that something is unclear or missing, you can update this sample and file a pull request. Also spelling mistakes or wrong wording can be changed and a pull request can be send.

IMPORTANT: If you change the difficulty or the buzz-words, remember to also update the main page. 

==== Adding a new sample

. Add a new Project to the Solution `src ‚ñ∫ Avalonia.Samples ‚ñ∫ Avalonia.Samples.sln`
. In the root directory of the new sample add a `ReadMe`-file. We highly suggest to use the template which you can find here: 
  .. link:/_docs/AsciiDoc-Template/[AsciiDoc-Template]: If you want to provide richer content, we suggest to use the https://asciidoc.org[ascii-doc]-template. 
  .. link:/_docs/Markdown-Template/[Markdown-Template]: If you don't like option a), you can use also the Markdown-template.
