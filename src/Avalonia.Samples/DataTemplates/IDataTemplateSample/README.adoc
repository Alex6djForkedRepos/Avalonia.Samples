// Write a short summary here what this examples does
This example will show you how to implement `IDataTemplate` in your own class to have full control over your `DataTemplates`. Other than in WPF, Avalonia does *not* have a https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.datatemplateselector?view=windowsdesktop-7.0[[`DataTemplateSelector`\]]. Therefore you will learn in this sample how you can mimic this in Avalonia if needed.

== Before we start

You should already have a basic knowledge of `DataTemplates`.

=== IDataTemplate

http://reference.avaloniaui.net/api/Avalonia.Controls.Templates/IDataTemplate/[[`IDataTemplate`\]] is an interface which you can implement into your own class in order to be used as a `DataTemplate`. It has the following members:

bool Match(object)::
Use this function to return if the given object matches to your `DataTemplate`.

IControl Build(object)::
Use this function to build the control which represents the given object.


== The Solution

We will create a convenient way to select a matching `DataTemplate` based on an `enum` value. The possible `DataTemplates` can be defined in `XAML` which should feel familiar to most developers.
