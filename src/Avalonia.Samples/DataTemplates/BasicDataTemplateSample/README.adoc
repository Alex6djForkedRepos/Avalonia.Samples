DataTemplate, ToString, StringFormat, MVVM, ItemTemplate, ContentTemplate



== Before we start

You should have a basic knowledge about string format in `C#` and about the `MVVM`-pattern.

=== DataTemplates

In Avalonia you can use https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/templates/data-templates[[`DataTemplates`\]] to control how your data is shown. You can define the `DataType` which the `DataTemplate` is made for. The `DataType` can be any `class` or `interface`. 

=== ToString

If no `DataTemplate` is found that matches your `object`, Avalonia will call `ToString()` and display the result in a `TextBlock`. You can https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-override-the-tostring-method[[override `ToString()`\]] in your own `classes`, if you want to return a custom string.
