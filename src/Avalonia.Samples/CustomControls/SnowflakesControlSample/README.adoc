// ----------------------------------------------------------



// Write a short summary here what this examples does
This example will show you how to create a custom control that overrides `OnRender` in order to have advanced render capabilities. It also shows how custom hit-testing can help to solve special tasks. We will create a simple game where the user should collect some snow flakes with their mouse pointer.

== Before we start

In this sample we assume that you are familiar with Avalonia, the `MVVM`-pattern and how to create custom `Controls` and define `AvaloniaProperties`. If this is new to you, please start with other tutorials first:

- xref:../../../../README.adoc#_mvvm_samples[[MVVM-Basics\]]
- xref:../../CustomControls/RatingControlSample/README.adoc[[RatingControlSample\]]
- https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/guides/custom-controls/[[Avalonia-Documentation\]]

=== When to Render on your own

There may be some special cases where a `TemplatedControl`, `ContentControl` or similar is not well suited, for example:

* If you need to display complex geometry
* If you have many objects to render which otherwise adds a huge layout-overhead
* If you need to control each render step
* if you want to use special things otherwise not available, such as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/skiasharp?view=skiasharp-2.88[[custom SkiaSharp-drawings\]]

=== Defining the game concept

Before we finally start to implement the game, we should make some considerations how our control should look like and how it should work. To shorten it, we use a plain list of notes:

* The game will have only one level
* The game must not run infinite -> We need a way to start and stop the game
* The game must render several snowflakes (represented as circles)
    ** Each snowflake should have a random start position
    ** Each snowflake should be able move with different speed
    ** Snowflakes should be of different sizes
* The user should be able to collect some score
    ** The user must be able to collect snowflakes with their mouse device
    ** The user should be able to see their current score
    ** Nice to have: Show a score indicator for each snowflake


== The Solution

// This is where you explain the possible solution you provide in this sample. 
// If you have more than one option to solve the issue, use Approach 1, Approach 2, ... 

We will create a custom control that will draw itself based on the data provided.

NOTE: To show you how this control can be bound to a `ViewModel` we will use the `MVVM`-pattern for demonstration here, even if it is not really needed in our case.

=== Step 1: Prepare the Snowflake-Model

In the folder `Models` we create a new file `Snowflake.cs` which will have the following properties:

[source,csharp]
----
public double X { get; private set; } // the X-posotion in relative units (0 .. 1)
public double Y { get; private set; } // the Y-posotion in relative units (0 .. 1)
public double Diameter { get; }       // The diameter of the snowflake in pixels
public double Radius { get; }         // The radius of the snowflake in pixels
public double Speed { get; }          // The speed of the snowflake in pixels / second
----

As we want the control to be of any size, we store the position in relative units which we need to convert into the actual viewport on request.

TIP: In Avalonia you can use `Bounds` to get the controls viewport.
