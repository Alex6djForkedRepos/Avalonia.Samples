== Before we start

This sample assumes that you have a basic knowledge about the following topcis:

- How to create a https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/get-started/test-drive/create-a-project[[new Avalonia project\]]
- Some basics about C# and https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/get-started/test-drive/[[XAML\]]
- What the link:../../MVVM/BasicMvvmSample[[MVVM -pattern\]] (Model-View-ViewModel) is and how it works

=== CommunityToolkit.MVVM

The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/[[CommunityToolkit.MVVM\]]-package is one of many third-party packages for MVVM-Apps. We will use it in this sample as it is very lightweight. In addition, it comes with built-in source generators which allows us to write less boilerplate code.

NOTE: If you want to learn more about how these source generators work, please see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/generators/overview[[here\]] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview[[here\]].

=== Preparation work

Before we start with the actual implementation of the App we need to define a list of requirements and a sketch of the UI.

**Must-Haves**

- The user must be able to view a list of to-do items
- All items must be easily discoverable
- The user must be able to check and uncheck the to-do items
- The user must be able to add new items
- The user must be able to delete an item

**Nice-To-Haves**

- The user should have a visual feedback when hovering a to-do item
- The user should have a visual feedback if a new item can be added or not
- The user should be able to save and load a to-do-list (not a scope of this tutorial)
- The user should be able to edit an existing item (not a scope of this tutorial)

**Draft UI Layout**

It would be nice to have a single page user interface (UI) where the user can interact with the to-do list. We will use the system window frame to present our App. In the bottom of the page the user will have a `TextBox` where they can type any item content to add. A `Watermark` or `ToolTip` shall indicate that visually. As soon as we receive valid input for a new item, a `Button` next to the input field should be enabled. If the user invokes this `Button`, the new item will be added into our list. The list itself will fill the rest of our available space. In case the space is not enough to render all items, a `ScrollBar` will enable vertical scrolling.
Each item in the list is going to be represented by a `CheckBox` followed by the content and a `Button` to delete the item.

== The Solution

NOTE: In this sample we will use the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) approach, where we will start with the Model and ViewModel first.
