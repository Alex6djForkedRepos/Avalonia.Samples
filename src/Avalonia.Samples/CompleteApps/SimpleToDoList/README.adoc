== Before we start

This sample assumes that you have a basic knowledge about the following topcis:

- How to create a https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/get-started/test-drive/create-a-project[[new Avalonia project\]]
- Some basics about C# and https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/get-started/test-drive/[[XAML\]]
- What the link:../../MVVM/BasicMvvmSample[[MVVM -pattern\]] (Model-View-ViewModel) is and how it works

=== CommunityToolkit.MVVM

The https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/[[CommunityToolkit.MVVM\]]-package is one of many third-party packages for MVVM-Apps. We will use it in this sample as it is very lightweight. In addition, it comes with built-in source generators which allows us to write less boilerplate code.

NOTE: If you want to learn more about how these source generators work, please see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/generators/overview[[here\]] and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview[[here\]].

=== Preparation work

Before we start with the actual implementation of the App we need to define a list of requirements and a sketch of the UI.

**Must-Haves**

- The user must be able to view a list of to-do items
- All items must be easily discoverable
- The user must be able to check and uncheck the to-do items
- The user must be able to add new items
- The user must be able to delete an item

**Nice-To-Haves**

- The user should have a visual feedback when hovering a to-do item
- The user should have a visual feedback if an item can be added or not
- The user should be able to save and load a to-do-list (not a scope of this tutorial)

// This is where you explain the possible solution you provide in this sample. 
// If you have more than one option to solve the issue, use Approach 1, Approach 2, ...
